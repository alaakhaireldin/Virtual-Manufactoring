# Virtual-Manufactoring
Analyzing the path movement of a forklift

The project is a full-stack project, where we draw a path for a particle on X/Y coordinates. 
A login page is created where the password is required to open the dashboard page.

The user then can uploads a background picure for the forklift/particle environment, the units for the steps, and the log file (csv) for x/y coordinates to draw the path.
