Analyzing the path movement of a forklift (ONGOING PROJECT) 

Creating a full-stack project that analyzes the path movement of a forklift involves building a system that monitors and records the movements of a forklift as it moves through a facility or warehouse. This may involve using sensors or other tracking technologies to gather data on the forklift's location and movement, and developing algorithms or machine learning models to analyze this data in order to generate insights or predictions about the forklift's path. However, this project is using a CSV file with data on the forklift's movements.

Please note that this project is being built at the moment, and it is at stage number 4, please read the steps below.

The steps for creating this project are: 
1- Consider what features are needed to include, what technologies to use, and how the project work.
2- Design the user interface for the project.
3- Create a database to store user data and project data. In this project, MongoDB and AWS S3 are used.
4- Set up a server to handle requests and responses from the frontend. In this project, Express.js framework is used.
5- Develop APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow the frontend to communicate with the backend. 
6- Set up authentication and authorization to control access to the project upload page and the spaghetti diagram page.
7- Test the project to ensure that it is working as intended.
8- Deploy the project.
